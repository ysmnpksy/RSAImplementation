# RSA Implementation using Java

## Project Description 
This project consists of a command line program which generates public and private keys, allowing users to encrypt and decrypt messages using the RSA algorithm. Each key is 4096 bits, making it almost impossible to crack with the technology available. 

## How to install & use the project 
A JAR file is included in the repository, which can be downloaded and run from the command line using the command `java -jar mini-project.jar`.

For full access to the code, download the code in a zipped folder from the repository and run from the command line using the line `java Main.java`

## File Breakdown
This project consists of 5 files: 

- Main.java: Includes the functionality for the user interface. 
- KeySet.java: Class to generate the public and private key values. 
- User.java: Data structure to store username and key values. 
- Encrypt.java: Functionality to encrypt messages.
- Decrypt.java: Functionality to decrypt messages.
